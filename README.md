# registries-of-practice-project 
The "Registries of Good Practice" Project will explore and develop different approaches to analyze, collate, present and, most importantly, make discoverable the many existing registries and collections of digital preservation good practice.

- The high-level project plan and progress is [openly accessible as a GitHub project](https://github.com/orgs/digipres/projects/2/views/1).
- The offical DPC project page is __TBC__

## Updates

- 2024-02-16 - Formal project annoucement: [New project launched to help practitioners discover digital preservation resources](https://www.dpconline.org/news/registries-of-good-practice)
- 2024-02-23 - DPC Blog: [Goals & Principles](https://www.dpconline.org/blog/registries-of-practice-goals-principles)

## Goals

To explore the following issues:

- What is the current ‘landscape’ of active and openly-accessible registries of things like format, software, tools and workflows, and how are they being used in practice? How do vendors integrate and use them? How does that compare with what practitioners do with them, and how registry maintainers build them? What works well? What’s not so good? How could things be improved?
- How do practitioners work towards ‘good practice’, and could ‘registries of practice’ help? What methods do people use to improve their practices? How do we build on the work of others, and avoid reinventing the wheel? What are the good sources of information about practical digital preservation? How useful are the iPres proceedings in this regard? How can we improve the discoverability of these kinds of resources?
- What are the common practices used to build and maintain technical registries themselves? What are the constraints we’re operating under? How does that affect the kind of approaches we can take? What kinds of contributions are welcome, and through which channels?

The intended outcomes are:

- An established _Preservation Registries Special Interest Group (PR-SIG)_ where people can come together to talk about digital preservation registries.
- A range of formal and information publications documenting the current state of our registries.
- New tools to help us improve our practices and maintain our registries.

## Collaboration

- Through the _PR-SIG_
- On GitHub.
  
## Principle
